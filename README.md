# C Vector
A simple library for dynamic sized arrays written in C programming language. Implementation is closely referenced to the `vector<T>` library presetn in C++'s STL.

## Usage instruction
- `#include cvector.h` in the client file(see `test.c` for reference) 
- compile cvector.h and cvector.c along with the client file(test.c in this case) using gcc or clang.  
Example: ``` gcc cvector.c cvector.h test.c -o foo ```
- run the executable  
Example: `./foo`
